# Trias: an encoder-decoder model for generating synthetic eukaryotic mRNA sequences

Trias is an encoder-decoder language model trained to reverse-translate protein sequences into codon sequences. It learns codon usage patterns from 10 million mRNA coding sequences across 640 vertebrate species, enabling context-aware sequence generation without requiring handcrafted rules.
